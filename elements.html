									<h4>Project Description</h4>
									<p>Udemy provides online education to thousands of people. Among these thousands of people are vast differences in interests as well as 
										education levels. This project focuses on four different course subjects Udemy offers. Web Development, Design, Music, and Business and Finance. 
										The nature of this project is to highlight the revenues for each course. And decipher how they can increase earnings with this information. 
										Through analysis of the four aforementioned courses, Udemy can begin to have an answer to their problem. Which is increasing their quarterly earnings.</p>

										<h4>Business Problem</h4>
										<p>Maximizing Revenue Potential: Udemy's Strategy for Increases Earnings and Course Success</p>
									</header>
									<p>Udemy needs to find a way to increase their next quarterly earnings. They have to analyze the revenue for each course and see where they can 
										potentially increase revenue. To do this they need to collect data on course prices for each subject. They also need to collect data on customer 
										retention and course ratings. I would also need to ask, which course is the most popular? Which course do customers pay the most for? What makes 
										the most popular course different from the rest? All of this analysis needs to be done in three weeks time. And presented in the form of a report 
										the manager can bring to the CEO. </p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<h5>Data Design</h5>
									<blockquote>In order to ensure there was accurate data to work with, the data needed to be cleaned. The primary goal was to have a set of data that is not 
										incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted. To achieve this I first removed any data that was duplicated. This would make final 
										numbers for categories such as number of subscribers more accurate. Having clear headers is very important in the cleaning process. Clear and concise headers 
										make it easier to perform certain functions needed to analyze the data.
										<p></p>
										It’s also important to have visually appealing data. I removed all of the blank spaces in the raw data to make it easy to look at and maneuver. To bring the 
										data to life, I used Excel and Tableau. With Excel, I was able to work in the same location as the raw data. Making it easier to input functions and equations 
										to analyze the data. The graph to the right is an example of a visualization of the data I created inputting a certain function in Excel.
										<p></p>
										With Tableau, there are many more options on how to make a visual render of the data. It gives room to be more specific and create a more appealing visual. 
										</blockquote>
									<h5>Code Clean Up Sample</h5>
									<pre><code>VLOOKUP:

=VLOOKUP('Data_Sheet_Udemy_Courses_-_Business_Courses'!D3,'Data_Sheet_Udemy_Courses_-_Business_Courses'!D:N,11,FALSE)
  
IF Statements:
=IF(D8=0,"Free","Paid")

									<h3>Analysis</h3>
									<p></span>Web development is by far the most popular course Udemy offers. It has the most subscribers out of all the other subjects, possessing 67.9% 
										of the total subscribers. It is also the most expensive course in every level. On the other hand Udemy’s music course is suffering. It is the least popular 
										with only 7.2% of the total subscribers. It even has the lowest ratings at every level compared to all the other courses. 
										<p></p>
										It may be tempting to increase the cost of the Web Development course since it is the most subscribed. But it is also the most expensive. And the longest to 
										go through. And the most important thing is course quality and customer satisfaction because that will increase customer retention. Web Development is not the 
										highest rated course which means spiking the price might deter people from using it. 
										<p></p>
										On the other hand, Udemy can increase the cost of the graphic design course, specifically the expert level, to increase revenue. Its expert level has the highest 
										rating out of all the subjects. Yet it has the lowest cost at the same level. With the assurance of it having good ratings, Udemy can increase the price expert 
										level for the graphic design course. This will increase revenue and increase next quarter’s earnings. 
										<p></p>
										Additionally, Udemy can focus on improving their Musical course. Increasing the duration of the course could increase its overall ratings. It will give subscribers 
										more content to learn from. With a better quality course, Udemy can charge significantly more for it. Which will also help to increase course revenue. 
										<p></p>
										Udemy already has all the components it needs to succeed. To increase revenue, Udemy should increase the cost of the Graphic Design course. Specifically at the 
										expert level. Furthermore, the Musical course can be improved by adding more materials to increase the duration. This will increase its ratings allowing you to 
										charge more for the course. Following these steps, Udemy should have an appreciating increase in quarterly revenue.
